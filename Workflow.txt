Workflow

Frontend (Nathan Rogers)
• Develop web app to display visualizations
• The web app should be able to graphically display pharmaceutical prescriber data
  JavaScript library examples

Backend (Blake Whitman)
• Add the ability to report on who the top doctors are based on total prescriptions (TRx) by
product
    - more prescriptions == better (potentially)
• Add the ability to report on the trend of total prescriptions (TRx) based on product
    - need to filter by product before analyzing trend of TRx (line graph)
• Add the ability to predict future top targets based on new prescriptions (NRx)
    - assuming we understand what this means, we are searching for high counts of new prescriptions for drugs; these are the possible contenders for future "top      
    targets"
